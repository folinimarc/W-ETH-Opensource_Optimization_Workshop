    "Pyomo is a powerful modelling framework in python. It bridges the gap between how we as modellers think and what the solvers want. Think of __pyomo as a translator__. It takes your code and translates it to a variety of solver interfaces, ranging from the freely available solvers of the coin-or project (awesome guys, check them out <a href=\"https://www.coin-or.org/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>) to commercial solvers like <a href=\"http://www.gurobi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">gurobi</a>. Because pyomo is a translator and not a solver itself, it is your responsability to install a suitable solver on your system and point pyomo to it. Depending on your problem - Linear (LP), Integer (IP), Mixed-Integer (MIP), Non-Linear (NLP) - I recommend to have a look at these free solvers from coin-or: cbc (LP, IP, MIP) and ipopt (NLP). You can find the cbc solver used in this tutorial in the folder called _Solvers."

    "We start by importing the pyomo package. To build a model in pyomo, we then first create an empty model object. To this model object, we subsequently add __components__ using the dot (.) notation. When we added all necessary components, we choose a solver and let pyomo handle the dirty translation work - et voil√†. Commonly used components are:\n",
    "- Decision variables\n",
    "- Objectives\n",

    "- Index sets\n",

The counterpart would be an abstract model, where the model structure is completely separated from the problem specific data.

    "## Understanding index sets and decision variables\n",
    "A set is a collection of distinct items, e.g. a collection of strings {\"Andi\", \"Stef\", \"Karin\"} or integers {0, 1, 2, 3}. In pyomo speech, components like decision variables can be indexed over an __index set__ during creation. In other words, we can use an index set to create a decision variable for each item in said set. The set items then act as keys for accessing (indexing) the corresponding decision variable. That works, because decision variables in pyomo are implemented using a dictionary like data structure, whereby the index set item is the key and the actual value of the decision variable (binary, real, etc.) is the corresponding value. \n",
    "\n",
    "__To that end, an index set is a set that is used in the context of the creation of a pyomo component (here decision variables), whereby the set items act as keys to access (index) said component.__\n",
    "\n",
    "That means, we can use the set {\"Andi\", \"Stef\", \"Karin\"} as index set when creating decision variable X. This will result in the creation of 3 distinct decision variables of type X, which can be accessed via X[\"Andi\"], X[\"Stef\"] and X[\"Karin\"]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarily, if we use the integer set {0, 1, 2, 3} as index set when creating decision variable Y, this will result in 4 decision variables of type Y. They can be accessed via Y[0], Y[1], Y[2], Y[3]. Note how using an integer set starting from 0 can give the impression that Y is actually a 1-dimensional array, which is not true. Lucky us, because the dictionary like implementation is much more flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyomo also allows to index a component over multiple index sets. In that case all possible combinations of indices are constructed and the decision variable is accessed much like a dictionary with multi-dimensional key. This allows for a very intuitive representation of hierarchically structured decision variables. Let's look at an example using the two index sets {\"Andi\", \"Stef\", \"Karin\"} and {0, 1, 2, 3}. We may encounter a situation where we need a decision variable for each person, whereby each person has 4 choices. We can easily represent this hierarchical structure in pyomo by indexing decision variable Z over both index sets. This will lead to the creation of 12 (3 names * 4 choices) decision variables of type Z, which can be accessed by Z[\"name\", choice], e.g. Z[\"Andi\",0], Z[\"Andi\",1], Z[\"Andi\",2], Z[\"Andi\",3], Z[\"Stef\",0], Z[\"Stef\",1], etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "#### It may take some time to get your head around this concept. Just remember this: Properly defining your index sets is key for making your life easy down the road. This is the reason I will also emphasize index sets in the mathematical modelling part as well as in the code."

We first create a solver object from it by specifying the name of the solver (here we use cbc as it is a IP problem) and the path where pyomo can find the solver. The path to the solver was defined at the very top of this section and saved to the variable $solver\\_path$.\n",
    "We then pass the model to the solver object. We save a the log of the solver in a file called solver_lot.txt in the folder logs. With the keyword tee=True, the output is also printed. Of particular interest is the information, whether the an optimal solution was found."

Remember that decision variables resemble the dictionary data structure and therefore we can apply a typical construct that is often used to print all key:value pairs of dictionaries.
